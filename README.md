## Assignment

1. (By hand) Design an HMM for POS tagging on a provided dataset, including a drawing of the HMM structure.
2. Use supervised learning -- with a random 90% of the labeled dataset -- to obtain the probabilities needed for the HMM.
3. Using the learned paramter values, label the remaining 10% of the sentences using the Viterbi algo and the given POS tags.  Implement the Viterbi algo yourself.  Report precision (how many labels are correct).  Repeat #2 and #3 a few times and report average results.
4. _Extra Credit:_ Use expectation maximization to learn the parameters using the unlabeled dataset. Compute precision as done in #3.

## Dataset
Data was generated by Professor Kalita and the class.

## Usage
This project is intended to be used via the CLI.

```sh
npm install
npm link

rdnHmm --help
```

### Testing
```sh
npm install
npm test
```

### Results on "Full" Dataset

```sh
$ time rdnhmm  -i data/full/ -r .9 -n 10000 -q
Results from 10000 iterations of the HMM:
