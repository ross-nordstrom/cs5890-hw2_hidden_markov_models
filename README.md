## Assignment

1. (By hand) Design an HMM for POS tagging on a provided dataset, including a drawing of the HMM structure.
2. Use supervised learning -- with a random 90% of the labeled dataset -- to obtain the probabilities needed for the HMM.
3. Using the learned paramter values, label the remaining 10% of the sentences using the Viterbi algo and the given POS tags.  Implement the Viterbi algo yourself.  Report precision (how many labels are correct).  Repeat #2 and #3 a few times and report average results.
4. _Extra Credit:_ Use expectation maximization to learn the parameters using the unlabeled dataset. Compute precision as done in #3.
